The Jupyter Notebook for the Predictive Individual Assignment

Over the last few years, the music industry has been dominated by digital streaming services, which produce vast amounts of data on listeners and their preferences.

This has required major players in the industry to adopt a data driven approach to content delivery in order to stay competitive.

Warner Music Group is looking to leverage its rich database to better understand the factors that have the most significant impact on the success of a new artist. This will allow them to optimize the allocation of resources when signing and promoting new artists.

Warnerâ€™s (large) database contains several sources of data, including the streaming platforms Spotify, Amazon Live and Apple Music.

For this case study, we will be looking using the Spotify dataset to predict the success of artists. In particular, we want to understand the role of Spotify playlists on the performance of artist.
